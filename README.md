# BudgetApp

BudgetApp is a simple and intuitive budget management application built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **TypeScript**, and **Zustand** for state management. The application currently stores user information locally using **LocalStorage**, with plans to integrate a backend for storing user transactions in the future.

## Features

- **Multiple Accounts**: Users can create and manage one or more money accounts.
- **Expense & Income Tracking**: Add expenses and income to keep track of financial movements.
- **Automatic Calculations**: The app automatically calculates and displays how each account is being used.
- **Budgeting System**: Users can set monthly budget targets to control expenses.
- **Local Storage**: All user data is saved locally for quick access.
- **Future Backend Integration**: Plans to introduce a backend to store user financial movements securely.
